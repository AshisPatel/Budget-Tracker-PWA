<h1>Budget Tracker - PWA</h1>
  
  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  Budget Tracker is a simple Progressive Web Application (PWA) that one can use track their expenses. The application is hosted via Heroku and communicates with a MongoDB database via Express & mongoose. The application also has the ability to store POST request data made by the user if the application goes offline / is slow to respond in the browser using IndexedDB. The data in the IndexedDB store is added to the MongoDB database when the client's browser regains stable connection. Then, the data is removed from the IndexedDB store. Furthermore, this application takes advantage of the browser's Cache API utilizing service workers. The service workers will capture the css, js, and html assets of the application and cache them upon the application loading. Then, if the client is ever to lose connection to the server's assets, the cached assets are used instead.
